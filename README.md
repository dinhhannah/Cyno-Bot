# Say hello to “Cyno Says”!

*Cyno Says* is a Discord bot based on the character Cyno from the video game Genshin Impact. With basic functions to guard, chat, and *entertain*, let the General Mahamatra of the Sumeru Akademiya be your Discord server guardian of justice today!

(It’s called “*Cyno Says*” because the name *Cyno* sounds similar to the name *Simon*, which is the eponymous character of the children’s game “Simon Says.” Get it? Haha.)

This bot was created using unofficial character.ai API made by kramcat
* Character.ai --> https://beta.character.ai/
* API for c.ai --> https://github.com/kramcat/CharacterAI

***Warning***: This code cannot run on Jupyter Notebook due to instance creation issues. The code *must* be run locally instead. 

## How to talk to Cyno

The format to prompt @Cyno is as follows: 

```
[text input] @Cyno
```

For example, *$hello @Cyno* is one way of summoning Cyno!

## To Do
* Reply as the fictional character ___ from the video game ___ to the following text: "___"
* Filter out the "@Cyno" part and put text input into the API
