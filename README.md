# Say hello to “Cyno Says”!

*Cyno Says* is a Discord bot based on the character Cyno from the video game Genshin Impact. With basic functions to guard, chat, and *entertain*, let the General Mahamatra of the Sumeru Akademiya be your Discord server guardian of justice today!

(It’s called “*Cyno Says*” because the name *Cyno* sounds similar to the name *Simon*, which is the eponymous character of the children’s game “Simon Says.” Get it? Haha.)

***Warning***: This code cannot run on Jupyter Notebook due to instance creation issues. The code *must* be run locally instead. 

The format to prompt @Cyno is as follows: 

```
[command] @Cyno
```

For example, *$hello @Cyno* is one way of summoning Cyno! 

## Commands

* $hello
* $joke
* $explain
